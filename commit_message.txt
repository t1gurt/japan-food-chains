feat: translate library helper files to English

Translated lib directory helper files:
- analytics-events.ts: Translated all Japanese comments to English
- chain-metadata.ts: Translated all chain descriptions, specialties, and metadata text to English

All library files now use English text while maintaining Japanese restaurant names and cultural terminology.
